# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines that leads to incorrect results. The bug is related to an aggregation pipeline that calculates the sum of values, grouped by a specific field, but produces an inaccurate sum. The solution shows how to correct this error by carefully reviewing the aggregation pipeline and ensuring the correct accumulators are used for the desired aggregation operation.

## Bug
The provided `bug.js` file contains an aggregation pipeline with a potential error in the `$group` stage. Due to a logic error, the aggregation produces an inaccurate sum of values.  The exact cause may involve an issue with the field being grouped on, or it may be the case that the wrong aggregation operator is used. Review the code to determine the exact cause and try to understand the circumstances under which this bug could manifest.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected aggregation pipeline. The fix ensures the accurate calculation of the sum by using appropriate MongoDB operators within the `$group` stage.  The corrected query will produce the expected and accurate aggregation results.  The solution will explicitly and clearly demonstrate the correction made to eliminate the bug.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure MongoDB is running.
3. Run the `bug.js` script (e.g., using `mongo < bug.js`) to observe the incorrect aggregation result.
4. Run the `bugSolution.js` script (e.g., using `mongo < bugSolution.js`) to see the corrected result.
